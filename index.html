               A Full-stack developer is a technical person who has the potential to work on both front end and back end of a software application. These developers possess a deep understanding of technologies used to implement different components and layers in a software product.
            Full-stack Developers should have an understanding of the following:
        </p> 
            
            <h3>Presentation Layer</h3>
           <p>
               The layer deals with the front end part of the application, i.e., user interfaces 
          </p> 

           <h3>Business Logic Layer</h3> 

          <p>
              he business logic layer deals with the back end part of the application, for e.g. data validation, connectivity between the user interface and web.
        </p>

           <h3>Database Layer</h3>
           <p>
            This layer deals with the database connectivity with the application’s front end.

                <strong>Front end developers</strong> build how a website looks.
            </strong>Backend developers</strong> build how a website works
                Let’s say that you wanted to build a WordPress website for your business. The frontend developer would create the theme: the images, style, and presentation. While the backend developer may work on managing the database, as well as the site’s users, security, and site performance issues.
            </p>
            <p>
                <p><strong>programming Languages</strong></p>
                Frontend developers primarily use three languages:  HTML, CSS, Javascript. Over the past few years, the role of the front-end developer has evolved, and so professional frontend devs might also want to consider developing some more intermediate to advanced JavaScript skills, as well as building up experience using command line tools and a framework such as React.
                
                Backend developers need to be proficient in programming languages that render on the server side of a website or application. The most popular backend programming languages are PHP, Ruby, Python, Node.js, and Java. Typically a good backend developer will be a master at one of these languages, but familiar enough to code in a 2nd or 3rd programming language. Backend developers will also need to proficient in working with databases like MySQL, Oracle, and SQL Server.
            </p>

            <p>
                <p><strong>Salary</strong></p>

                <em>Front end dev:</em> $70,000 USD (average base pay according to Glassdoor.) With a range from $56k to $111k. And an hourly rate of around $50/hour.
                
              <p>
                  <em>Backend dev:</em>  $117,000 USD (average base pay according to Glassdoor). With a range from $100k to $140k. And an hourly rate of around $65/hour.
              </p>
                
                The salaries can vary dramatically based on your experience (noted by junior, lead, and senior titles) and based on your specialties. Specialties also have an effect on salary, as noted by the difference in salary between a senior Javascript web developer who outearns the senior frontend developer.
                
                In addition, on sites like UpWork you’ll be able to find developers who charge anywhere from $10 per hour and to over $150 per hour. And so if you’re looking to hire a dev, you really must do your homework (aka. take time to review the developer’s portfolio, interview, and ask for references from past employers) in order to find the right match.

                Front end technologies are used for managing the user-facing components of the software product. A Full-stack developer should know how the software application should look like and what should be the flow of an app.

                Backend is the part of a software application that you cannot see. The backend of app deals with organizing and storing of data and ensures that everything runs robustly on the client side.
            </P>

            <P>
                Backend is responsible for interacting with the front end to receive and send information to be displayed on the web app. Whether you fill a form on the app, request to buy an item or save an item to the card, the app’s front end sends a request to the server which fetches information and displays it.

                HTML(HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).
            </p>
            <p>
                "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.

                <em>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</em> is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.

                CSS is one of the core languages of the open Web and is standardized across Web browsers according to the W3C specification. Developed in levels, CSS1 is now obsolete, CSS2.1 is a recommendation, and CSS3, now split into smaller modules, is progressing on the standardization track.

                JavaScript <em>(or "JS")</em> is a programming language used most often for dynamic client-side scripts on webpages, but it is also often used on the server-side, using packages such as <em>Node.js.</em>

                JavaScript should not be confused with the Java programming language. Although "Java" and "JavaScript" are trademarks (or registered trademarks) of Oracle in the U.S. and other countries, the two programming languages are significantly different in their syntax, semantics, and uses.

               JavaScript is mostly used in the browser, enabling developers to manipulate webpage content through the DOM, manipulate data with AJAX and IndexedDB, draw graphics with canvas, interact with the device running the browser through various APIs, and more. JavaScript is one of the world's most commonly-used languages, owing to the recent growth and performance improvement of APIs available in browsers.

            Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm,[6] unifying web-application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server- and client-side scripts.

           Though .js is the standard filename extension for JavaScript code, the name <blockquote"Node.js"></blockquote> doesn't refer to a particular file in this context and is merely the name of the product. Node.js has an event-driven architecture capable of asynchronous I/O.

           PHPis a general-purpose programming language originally designed for web development. It was originally created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994;[5] the PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group.[6] PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page,[5] but it now stands for the recursive initialism PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.[7]

            PHP code may be executed with a command line interface (CLI), embedded into HTML code, or used in combination with various web template systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks. PHP code is usually processed by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module in a web server or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. The web server outputs the results of the interpreted and executed PHP code, which may be any type of data, such as generated HTML code or binary image data. PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside of the web context, such as standalone

                <em>Structured Query Language)</em> is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS). It is particularly useful in handling structured data, i.e. data incorporating relations among entities and variables.
                
                SQL was one of the first commercial languages to utilize Edgar F. Codd’s relational model. The model was described in his influential 1970 paper, "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks".[10] Despite not entirely adhering to the relational model as described by Codd, it became the most widely used database language.[11][12]
                
                SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, and of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987.
